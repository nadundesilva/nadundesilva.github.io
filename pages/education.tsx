                            I studied for my four year bachelor&apos;s degree at
                            the {UniversityOfMoratuwa}. The degree covered many
                            in depth areas (e.g.:- Computer Architecture,
                            Operating Systems, Compiler Theory, Database
                            Internals) as well as noval technical areas (e.g.:-
                            Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining &amp;
                            Information Retrieval). The degree covered many
                            other aspects such as general engineering knowledge,
                            ethics and professional conduct.

                        with distinctions in all the subjects granting me
                        entrance into the {UniversityOfMoratuwa} as well.

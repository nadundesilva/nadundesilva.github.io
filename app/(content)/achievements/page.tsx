                    Each year for employees who have performed exceptionally
                    throughout the year, the Sustained Outstanding Contribution
                    Award is awarded. I was presented this award for several
                    consecutive years at {WSO2}. Along with the award I had been
                    commended many times for performing well above the expected
                    level for many years.

                <Paragraph>
                    In 2021, this award was changed to be only awarded for the
                    top 5% employees at {WSO2} making it extremely hard to
                    achieve. In the year 2021, I was offered this award with
                    only 18 other people in the whole company gaining the same
                    award. This is the best award offered for an employee for
                    exceptional performance at {WSO2}.

                    During my B.Sc. (Hons.) in Engineering (Computer Science and
                    Engineering) degree at the University of Moratuwa, I was
                    offered placements in the Dean&lsquo;s List for scoring a
                    GPA above 3.8 (out of 4.2) for 6 out of the 8 semesters I

                    We came up with a platform to map and compare population
                    genetics of a species with landscape features, climate
                    conditions, and human activities in a region to identify
                    potential barriers or facilitators to gene migration and
                    local adaptation. The platform at its core utilizes a
                    clustering algorithm for identifying patterns for
                    identifying any such barriers.

                    {WSO2} Internal Hackathon (WHack) was held for the first
                    time in 2017 which was open to all employees including
                    interns who worked there at that time. I was an intern at
                    that time at {WSO2} and I along with a few other interns
                    participated in the {WSO2}
                    internal hackathon. We proposed a system to track users
                    across multiple platforms for improving customer analytics
                    and thereby improve the customer experience as well. We were
                    presented with an honorable mention for this solution.

                    In {AngelHack} 2016, our team developed a smart workout
                    system which combined a virtual reality game with an
                    exercise bicycle fitted with a sensor to encourage people to
                    workout more.
                </Paragraph>
                <Photo float="left" photo={Photos.AngelHack2016Bike} />
                <Paragraph>
                    The game maps the user&lsquo;s movement on the bicycle to
                    movements on the game. The user is presented with targets
                    which they can achieve by collecting coins in their path. In
                    the final round where the finalists were tasked with
                    developing their concepts within a limited time frame, we
                    developed a working prototype which the judges were able to
                    try out as well.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    The game was built using Unity which received the signal
                    from the sensor attached to the exercise bicycle. The speed
                    at which the user pedaled the bicycle forward was mapped
                    into the speed at which the user moved within the game and
                    the slight movements of the head was mapped into the bicycle
                    making small turns. The path forward was designed to avoid
                    too much strain on the neck, but to simply provide an
                    enjoyable game for the user to enjoy while they exercised
                    using the bicycle.

                    teams from within Sri Lanka to provide solutions for
                    problems within Sri Lanka. In 2015, the teams were tasked
                    with addressing problems which were faced by people in Uva
                    province in Sri Lanka. Our team presented a platform which
                    provided entrepreneurs a place to showcase their skills and
                    products. The platform focussed on connecting entrepreneurs
                    with customers and investors to help bootstrap businesses in
                    the area.

                    revolutionizing education.

                    prefer to use books. However, there are many occasions where
                    the written word and diagrams are not enough to understand
                    complex concepts. The proposed system visualized drawings

                I studied for my four year bachelor&apos;s degree at the{" "}
                {UniversityOfMoratuwa}. The degree covered many in depth areas
                (e.g.:- Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Compiler
                Theory, Database Internals) as well as noval technical areas
                (e.g.:- Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining &amp;
                Information Retrieval). The degree covered many other aspects
                such as general engineering knowledge, ethics and professional
                conduct.

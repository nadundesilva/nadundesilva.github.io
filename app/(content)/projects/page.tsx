                {Choreo} is a Digital Platform as a Service which abstracts away
                the complexity of cloud native development and operations
                infrastructure so that the users can create new APIs,
                integrations and services in hours or days instead of weeks or
                months. {Choreo} has many features which makes the this possible
                such as AI assisted development, automated deployments in a
                secure and highly available environment, API Management, etc.
                Observability is one of the main areas in this puzzle which
                makes the operations easier for the users.

                {Choreo} has many features without differentiating too much
                across languages. However, it provides more capabilities for{" "}
                {Ballerina} which was originally built within {WSO2}. From
                development to deployment and production, there are many

                {Ballerina}. I worked on the Choreo project since it was
                initially started and was part of the initial team who worked on
                the foundation of it. During my employment at {WSO2}, the Choreo
                project was focussing a lot on implementing and improving the
                features around {Ballerina} provided in {Choreo}. I worked
                mainly on the Observability aspects of {Choreo} built around{" "}

                {Choreo} provided many capabilities for making the development
                to deployment and management of cloud native applications easy.
                One of these was the Low Code editor provided for {Ballerina}.
                To make things easier for development, {Choreo} provides an
                online VSCode editor with the Low Code editor and everything
                configured to develop the applications faster. I designed the
                scheduling of the online VSCode editor in {Choreo}, which
                involved scheduling the resources and configuring the routing to
                allow users to access the editor in a secure manner. Security,
                isolation of resources and the startup time were some of the
                most important aspects of the resource scheduling.

                One of the main features of {Ballerina} was the built-in

                {Cellery} is an implementation of the Cell Based Architecture
                which aims to improve productivity of the development of a
                complex microservices, across multiple teams. {Cellery}{" "}
                introduces microservice composites along with controls to reduce
                complexity and tools to improve productivity, ensuring that the
                best practices are met. I was part of the initial team who
                developed the initial implementation of {Cellery} and mainly
                worked on the Observability related of the framework. {Cellery}{" "}
                was built on top of {Kubernetes} and {Istio}. The Observability
                features were also built using them and presented to the users
                with context about the Cells that they create.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                {Cellery} also included a central repository (Cellery Hub) to
                which the users could push their Cells. This allowed users to
                reuse Cells and properly wire-up dependencies to manage their
                deployments efficiently. I worked on the implementation of some
                parts of Cellery Hub including the Docker Registry based
                storage, authentication and authorization of the frontend and
                the CLI used for pushing and pulling cells.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Another important part of {Cellery} was the dependency
                management which ensured that the deployments are done properly
                without failures. I worked on the dependency resolution and
                visualisation to improve the experience around deployments.

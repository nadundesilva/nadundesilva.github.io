                    In Kubernetes deployments when the same {Secret},{" "}
                    {ConfigMap} or {NetworkPolicy} needs to be accessed across
                    multiple namespaces, it needs to be manually created in all
                    of them, this handy Kubernetes controller can come to your
                    rescue. It will automatically watch the namespaces and
                    create the resources in them as soon as they are created. By
                    doing so, this will allow removing some of the burden on the
                    operational aspects

                    When working with a large deployment based on a
                    microservices architecture, it can get quite complex when
                    the number of microservices grows to a very large number.
                    This controller allows the users to declaratively specify
                    the microservices including its dependencies so that the
                    controller will properly manage them.

                        Ensuring that dependencies are not removed when
                        microservices using it is still using them.

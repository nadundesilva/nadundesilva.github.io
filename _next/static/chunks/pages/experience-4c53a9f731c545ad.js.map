While\n                            generally this level of responsibilities are not\n                            given to a Senior Software Engineer, I was trusted\n                            with it and I handled these responsibilities quite\n                            well, earning the top performance award for each\n                            year.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            The source code of {Ballerina} Observability was not\n                            actively maintained when I took over as the lead of\n                            the {Choreo} Observability Team. Therefore, I took\n                            over the responsibility of going through the code\n                            base and revamping the Observability instrumentation\n                            as well. The {Ballerina} compiler level\n                            instrumentation was previously performed at the\n                            lowest level of the compiler while writing the Java\n                            bytecode into the Java class files. However, this\n                            approach had its limitations as these instructions\n                            were not aware of scheduler level operations at this\n                            level. This resulted in some of the instructions\n                            getting executed twice due to the way Ballerina\n                            scheduler handled IO bound operations. To solve this\n                            issue, I worked on completely rewriting the\n                            Observability instrumentation at {Ballerina}{\" \"}\n                            compiler backend level by transforming the Ballerina\n                            Intermediate Representation (BIR) during the\n                            compilation. While this task was quite challenging\n                            due to the technologies it involved, the fact that\n                            almost no-one knew the source code well and the\n                            strict deadlines, I managed to complete this on time\n                            and with good quality.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            After the initial PoC was complete, the {Choreo}{\" \"}\n                            product also evolved and the Observability Team also\n                            gained new members. I was entrusted with continuing\n                            to lead the Observability Team while some of the\n                            product management aspects were handed over to\n                            others. I guided the team into implementing most of\n                            the core features of {Choreo} Observability and I\n                            helped and encouraged the engineers in my team to\n                            grow and improve themselves as well.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <HighlightsSection>\n                            <li>\n                                Spearheaded and implemented the foundation for\n                                Choreo observability within 3 months, with a\n                                team of 2 other engineers, creating the backbone\n                                of Choreo observability.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Architected the Choreo observability storages\n                                with data archival into a Data Lake, decreasing\n                                the cost by 90% for the company while storing\n                                the data for Machine Learning (ML) use cases.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Revamped the observability instrumentation at\n                                Ballerina compiler level, within 1 month, to map\n                                the observability data to the source code,\n                                providing a better debugging experience for\n                                users.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Minimized and maintained the lowest number of\n                                bugs across all areas within Choreo by\n                                implementing proper code reviewing, testing and\n                                deployment practices in a team of 6 engineers.\n                            </li>\n                        </HighlightsSection>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>Software Engineer</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan\n                            value={\n                                new TimeRange(\n                                    new Time(2018, \"January\"),\n                                    new Time(2019, \"July\"),\n                                )\n                            }\n                        />\n                        {wso2Logo}\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            At the start of my employment, I worked in multiple\n                            teams as part of the probation period. During one of\n                            these assignments, I implemented a password policy\n                            authenticator which is an authentication extension\n                            for the {Wso2IdentityServer}. It would validate a\n                            user login and enforce password policies.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            After completing this feature, I worked on a\n                            Customer Success Enablement project by analyzing\n                            customer data to provide insights for the support\n                            teams to better work towards improving the customer\n                            experience and ensure that proper support is\n                            provided to them. While I cannot disclose a lot of\n                            information on this task, I worked on generating\n                            several reports on demand by querying data from\n                            multiple sources and analyzing them. I also revamped\n                            the portal which was built to request a report and\n                            rewrote the portal using {React} which was quite new\n                            for me at that time as well.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            After getting instated as a permanent employee, I\n                            joined the Cloud Team at {WSO2} and worked on the{\" \"}\n                            {WSO2}\n                            Serverless Platform which was a new product being\n                            developed at that time. I worked on the\n                            Observability aspects of the platform and while this\n                            was a new area for me at that time, I managed to\n                            learn the observability space in a short time and\n                            implement a considerable amount of it along with\n                            another engineer. I also contributed ideas for the\n                            platform as a whole as well. The {WSO2} Serverless\n                            Platform was based on {ApacheOpenWhisk} and it\n                            allowed running any docker image in serverless mode\n                            which was a new concept at that time. However,\n                            almost near the time when we completed a basic but\n                            complete version of the platform, {KNative} which\n                            offered a similar experience was announced. As a\n                            result, the serverless platform was not offered as\n                            part of the product line of {WSO2} and it was\n                            discontinued.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Afterwards, I spent a few more weeks within the\n                            Cloud team including a month of customer support\n                            rotation, which helped me gain valuable experience\n                            in handling customer requests and also gain insights\n                            into other aspects of the business apart from the\n                            technical side of it.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            After Serverless Platform was discontinued, {WSO2}\n                            started another project named VICK (later named as{\" \"}\n                            {Cellery}) which was aimed towards making\n                            deployments in Kubernetes easier. I was selected to\n                            be part of the initial research team to implement\n                            the product. I worked on this project for some time\n                            and it evolved and along with the Cell based\n                            architecture, later became project {Cellery}. I\n                            mainly worked on the Observability aspects of the\n                            platform, but I contributed to almost all the other\n                            areas of the product with thoughts and ideas as\n                            well. While working on project {Cellery}, I was able\n                            to gain in depth knowledge on Kubernetes as well and\n                            this helped me immensely in my role as a software\n                            engineer later in my career.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <HighlightsSection>\n                            <li>\n                                Delivered the Cellery observability basic\n                                features within 2 months for observing\n                                microservice composites, using Kubernetes,\n                                Istio, OpenTracing and Envoy.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Headed the implementation of Cellery developer\n                                tools using Language Server Extensions and\n                                visualizations of Cells using D3.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Developed Cellery Hub backed by a Docker\n                                Registry as storage and authentication of the\n                                CLI and portal using OpenID Connect (OIDC),\n                                collaborating with a team, within 1 month.\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                Implemented the observability aspects of the\n                                WSO2 Serverless Platform using Prometheus and\n                                Jaeger on top of Kubernetes and OpenWhisk.\n                            </li>\n                        </HighlightsSection>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>\n                            Google Summer of Code Intern\n                        </SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan\n                            value={\n                                new TimeRange(\n                                    new Time(2017, \"May\"),\n                                    new Time(2017, \"September\"),\n                                )\n                            }\n                        />\n                        {gsocLogo}\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            During my last year at the University, in my spare\n                            time, I worked as a {GoogleSummerOfCode} intern.

I started working as a member of the Data\n                            Analytics Server (DAS) product team building a\n                            prototype Notebook for analyzing data collected by\n                            the DAS. However, the project was aborted and was\n                            not added to the DAS product as the company decided\n                            to discontinue the DAS product.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Afterwards, as part of the Complex Event Processor\n                            product team, I implemented several stream\n                            processing extensions under the extrema namespace\n                            for calculating maximum and minimum values in data\n                            streams.

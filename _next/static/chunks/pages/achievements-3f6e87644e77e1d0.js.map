I was an intern at that\n                            time at WSO2 and I along with a few other interns participated in the WSO2 internal\n                            hackathon. We proposed a system to track users across multiple platforms for improving\n                            customer analytics and thereby improve the customer experience as well. We were presented\n                            with an honorable mention for this solution.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>Angel Hack - Finalist</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan>2016</Timespan>\n                        {angelHackLogo}\n                        <Photo float={\"right\"} photo={Photos.AngelHack2016}/>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            In Angel Hack 2016, our team developed a smart workout system which combined\n                            a virtual reality game with an exercise bicycle fitted with a sensor to encourage\n                            people to workout more.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Photo float={\"left\"} photo={Photos.AngelHack2016Bike}/>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            The game maps the user&lsquo;s movement on the bicycle to\n                            movements on the game. The user is presented with targets which they can achieve by\n                            collecting coins in their path. In the final round where the finalists were tasked\n                            with developing their concepts within a limited time frame, we developed a working\n                            prototype which the judges were able to try out as well.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            The game was built using Unity which received the signal from the sensor attached\n                            to the exercise bicycle. The speed at which the user pedaled the bicycle forward\n                            was mapped into the speed at which the user moved within the game and the slight\n                            movements of the head was mapped into the bicycle making small turns. The path forward\n                            was designed to avoid too much strain on the neck, but to simply provide an enjoyable\n                            game for the user to enjoy while they exercised using the bicycle.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>HackaDev - Finalist</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan>2015</Timespan>\n                        {hackaDevLogo}\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            HackaDev is a competition which provides a platform for teams from within Sri Lanka\n                            to provide solutions for problems within Sri Lanka. In 2015, the teams were tasked\n                            with addressing problems which were faced by people in Uva province in Sri Lanka.\n                            Our team presented a platform which provided entrepreneurs a place to showcase\n                            their skills and products. The platform focussed on connecting entrepreneurs with\n                            customers and investors to help bootstrap businesses in the area.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>British Council HSBC Youth Enterprise Awards - Finalist</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan>2015</Timespan>\n                        {britishCouncilLogo}\n                        <Photo float={\"right\"} photo={Photos.HSBCYouthEnterpriseAwards2015}/>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            British Council HSBC Youth Enterprise Awards is a hackathon in which many teams\n                            presented ideas to help solve problems in different domains.

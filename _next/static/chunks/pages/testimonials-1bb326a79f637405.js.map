Nadun is a highly-skilled engineer,\n                            who has a vast breadth of knowledge on programming,\n                            software architecture, container orchestration,\n                            software engineering best practices etc. As the lead\n                            of Choreo&apos;s Observability team, Nadun&apos;s\n                            knowledge contributions towards successfully\n                            building the AI-based performance anomaly detector\n                            (the project that I worked in) was invaluable. As a\n                            senior engineer he was always approachable to us\n                            from the time of planning the project until\n                            deployment and even beyond that. As an individual, I\n                            learnt a lot from his technical knowledge and the\n                            vision he had on software development.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Apart from his technical skills, what makes Nadun\n                            stand out from other engineers is the fact that he\n                            genuinely spends time to help junior engineers in\n                            solving their issues. As a team lead I have seen\n                            numerous instances where he sat together with others\n                            in his team whenever problems arose and debug those.\n                            It was the same for us (who were members of another\n                            but closely related team) whenever we ran into\n                            issues related to observability. Existence of senior\n                            engineers such as Nadun at any workplace is a relief\n                            for newly joined engineers who are initially\n                            overwhelmed when learning the company culture and\n                            adapting to their respective projects, and I have\n                            personally experienced that as I started planning my\n                            project during the Covid period virtually.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            It was an absolute pleasure to work with and learn\n                            from a talented, kind-hearted and empathetic\n                            individual like Nadun.

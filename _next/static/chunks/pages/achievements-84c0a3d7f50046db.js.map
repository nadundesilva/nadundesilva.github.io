I\n                            was an intern at that time at {WSO2} and I along\n                            with a few other interns participated in the {WSO2}\n                            internal hackathon. We proposed a system to track\n                            users across multiple platforms for improving\n                            customer analytics and thereby improve the customer\n                            experience as well. We were presented with an\n                            honorable mention for this solution.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>Angel Hack - Finalist</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan value={new Time(2016)} />\n                        {angelHackLogo}\n                        <Photo float={\"right\"} photo={Photos.AngelHack2016} />\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            In {AngelHack} 2016, our team developed a smart\n                            workout system which combined a virtual reality game\n                            with an exercise bicycle fitted with a sensor to\n                            encourage people to workout more.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Photo\n                            float={\"left\"}\n                            photo={Photos.AngelHack2016Bike}\n                        />\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            The game maps the user&lsquo;s movement on the\n                            bicycle to movements on the game. The user is\n                            presented with targets which they can achieve by\n                            collecting coins in their path. In the final round\n                            where the finalists were tasked with developing\n                            their concepts within a limited time frame, we\n                            developed a working prototype which the judges were\n                            able to try out as well.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            The game was built using Unity which received the\n                            signal from the sensor attached to the exercise\n                            bicycle. The speed at which the user pedaled the\n                            bicycle forward was mapped into the speed at which\n                            the user moved within the game and the slight\n                            movements of the head was mapped into the bicycle\n                            making small turns. The path forward was designed to\n                            avoid too much strain on the neck, but to simply\n                            provide an enjoyable game for the user to enjoy\n                            while they exercised using the bicycle.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>HackaDev - Finalist</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan value={new Time(2015)} />\n                        {hackaDevLogo}\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            {HackaDev} is a competition which provides a\n                            platform for teams from within Sri Lanka to provide\n                            solutions for problems within Sri Lanka.

(Hons.) in Engineering (Computer Science and Engineering) degree. I started\n                            working as a member of the Data Analytics Server (DAS) product team building a\n                            prototype Notebook for analysing data collected by the DAS. However,\n                            the project was aborted and was not added to the DAS product when the company\n                            decided to discontinue the DAS product.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Afterwards, as part of the Complex Event Processor product team, I implemented\n                            several stream processing extensions under the extrema namespace for calculating\n                            maximum and minimum values in data streams. Afterwards, I worked on a prototype\n                            for generating suggestions in the editor component of the {Siddhi} IDE using data\n                            annotated into the {Siddhi} extensions through Java custom annotations. Moreover,\n                            I designed some of the initial wireframes of the {Siddhi} IDE as well before the\n                            end of my internship.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>Google Summer of Code Intern</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan>May 2017 to Sep 2017</Timespan>\n                        {GsocLogo}\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            During my last year at the University, in my spare time, I worked as a Google Summer\n                            of Code intern. I worked for WSO2 during this period as well and developed a maven plugin\n                            for automatically generating documentation for the {Siddhi} extensions. The information\n                            for the documentation was scraped from the data annotated into the extensions using a\n                            maven plugin and the collected data was converted into html pages using {mkDocs}. This was\n                            used by {Siddhi} for generating their documentation till it was decommissioned several years\n                            later.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>Software Engineer</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan>Jan 2018 to July 2019</Timespan>\n                        {Wso2Logo}\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            I was head hunted by WSO2 before the end of my degree and I was offered to start\n                            working as a Software Engineer at WSO2. At the start of my employment, I worked in\n                            multiple teams as part of the probation period. During one of these assignments,\n                            I implemented a password policy authenticator which is an authentication extension for\n                            the {wso2IdentityServer} which would validate and enforce password policies.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            After completing this feature, I worked on a Customer Success Enablement project\n                            by analyzing customer data to provide insights for the support teams to better work\n                            towards improving the customer experience and ensure that proper support is provided\n                            to them. While I cannot disclose a lot of information on this task, I worked on\n                            generating several reports on demand by querying data from multiple sources and\n                            analyzing them. I also revamped the portal which was built to request a report and\n                            rewrote the portal using {React} which was quite new for me at that time as well.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            After getting instated as a permanent employee, I joined the Cloud Team at WSO2 and\n                            worked on the WSO2 Serverless Platform which was a new product being developed at that\n                            time. I worked on the Observability aspects of the platform and while this was a new area\n                            for me at that time, I managed to learn the observability space in a short time and\n                            implement a considerable amount of it along with another engineer. I also contributed\n                            with ideas for the platform as a whole as well. The WSO2 Serverless Platform was based\n                            on {apacheOpenWhisk} and it allowed running any docker image in serverless mode which\n                            was a new concept at that time. However, almost near the time when we completed a basic\n                            but complete version of the platform, {knative} which offered a similar experience was\n                            announced. As a result, the serverless platform was not offered as part of the product\n                            line of WSO2 and it was discontinued.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Afterwards, I spent few more weeks within the Cloud team including a month of\n                            customer support rotation, which helped me gain valuable experience in handling customer\n                            requests and also gain insights into other aspects of the business apart from the\n                            technical side of it.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            After Serverless Platform was discontinued, WSO2 started another project named\n                            VICK (later named as {Cellery}) which was aimed towards making deployments in\n                            Kubernetes easier. I was selected to be part of the initial research team to\n                            implement the product. I worked on this project for some time and it evolved\n                            and along with the Cell based architecture later became project {Cellery}.\n                            I mainly worked on the Observability aspects of the platform, but I contributed\n                            to almost all the other areas of the product with thoughts and ideas as well.\n                            While working on project {Cellery}, I was able to gain in depth knowledge on\n                            Kubernetes as well and this helped me immensely in my role as a software\n                            engineer later in my career.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>Senior Software Engineer</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan>July 2019 to June 2021</Timespan>\n                        {Wso2Logo}\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Later, I completely owned the Observability area and mentored few interns as well\n                            as other junior engineers. I have also implemented parts of the CLI, VS Code Extension\n                            and other tools of {Cellery} which involved different new concepts and technologies\n                            which I learnt within short periods of time. Later when project {Choreo} was\n                            started, {Cellery} was adopted by the initial version of it as well, until later\n                            the project {Choreo} was rebooted and project {Cellery} was discontinued.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            When {Choreo} project initially started (rebooted from the very first implementation),\n                            I was again selected to the small team of engineers who were tasked to making it a reality.\n                            Two more engineers were also added to the {Choreo} Observability subteam and I was tasked\n                            with leading the implementation of {Choreo} Observability. I designed the core architecture\n                            of {Choreo} Observability and also worked on improving {Ballerina} Observability to\n                            support {Choreo} Observability better as well. While generally this level of responsibilities\n                            are not given to a Senior Software Engineer, I was trusted with it and I handled these\n                            responsibilities quite well and the Observability area later became one of the most stable\n                            areas and one of the main features of {Choreo} as well.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            The source code of {Ballerina} Observability was not actively maintained when I took over\n                            as the lead of the {Choreo} Observability Team. Therefore, I took over the responsibility of\n                            going through the code base and revamping the Observability instrumentation as well.\n                            The {Ballerina} compiler level instrumentation was previously performed at the lowest level\n                            of the compiler while writing the Java bytecode into the Java class files. However, this\n                            approach had its limitations as these instructions were not aware of scheduler level\n                            operations at this level. This resulted in some of the instructions getting executed twice\n                            due to the way Ballerina scheduler handled IO bound operations. To solve this issue, I\n                            worked on completely rewriting the Observability instrumentation at {Ballerina} compiler\n                            backend level by transforming the Ballerina Intermediate Representation (BIR) during the\n                            compilation. While this task was quite challenging due to the technologies it involved,\n                            the fact that almost no-one knew the source code well and the strict deadlines, I managed\n                            to complete this on time and with good quality.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            After the initial PoC was complete, the {Choreo} product also evolved and the Observability\n                            Team also gained new members and evolved as well. I was entrusted with continuing to lead\n                            the Observability Team while some of the product management aspects were handed over to others.\n                            I guided the team into implementing most of the core features of {Choreo} Observability and\n                            I helped and encouraged the engineers in my team to grow and improve themselves as well.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                    <Section>\n                        <SectionHeading>Associate Technical Lead</SectionHeading>\n                        <Timespan>June 2021 to Now</Timespan>\n                        {Wso2Logo}\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Even before being promoted to an Associate Technical Lead, I was performing way above my level\n                            and I continued to improve and grow within my new role as an Associate Technical Lead. I continued\n                            to lead the Observability team and it was considered one of the most stable areas in the platform\n                            during that time. Moreover, I guided multiple engineers and helped them improve for the better as well.\n                            Apart from that I also contributed to other areas such as growth hacking, UX, SRE and other aspects\n                            of the {Choreo} platform.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Apart from the Observability Area, I also led the effort on the Choreo Online VS Code Editor as well\n                            as implemented a significant portion of it. This feature also was finished on time and in good quality\n                            as well. This involved implementing a secure environment for users to edit their code.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                        <Paragraph>\n                            Throughout all this work, I always made myself available for other team members who approached me\n                            seeking for technical guidance or any clarifications about the platform. I also contributed to many\n                            other technical and architectural decision of the platform as well. Through all these, I still worked\n                            at the level of other engineers and kept up with the technical aspects as well. I always thought out\n                            of the box and helped improve many aspects of the platform as well.\n                        </Paragraph>\n                    </Section>\n                </LayoutContent>\n            </Layout>\n        </Container>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default Experience;\n","\n    (window.__NEXT_P = window.__NEXT_P || []).push([\n      \"/experience\",\n      function () {\n        return require(\"private-next-pages/experience.tsx\");\n      }\n    ]);\n    if(module.hot) {\n      module.hot.dispose(function () {\n        window.__NEXT_P.push([\"/experience\"])\n      });\n    }\n  "],"names":["children","appBarItems","window","trigger","useScrollTrigger","disableHysteresis","threshold","target","undefined","scrollToTopRef","useRef","useWebsiteTheme","colorScheme","setColorScheme","nextColorScheme","appBar","React","AppBar","Toolbar","Typography","variant","component","Box","sx","flexGrow","Tooltip","title","IconButton","marginLeft","size","onClick","icon","faMoon","faSun","transform","elevation","ref","Container","maxWidth","disableGutters","overflowX","textAlign","paddingTop","paddingBottom","color","Zoom","Z","in","current","scrollIntoView","behavior","block","role","position","bottom","right","Fab","faChevronUp","BREADCRUMBS_MAP","pathnames","useRouter","pathname","split","filter","x","Breadcrumbs","margin","separator","faChevronRight","passHref","href","map","value","index","last","length","to","slice","join","marginBottom","px","xs","lg","xl","useState","direction","setDirection","offset","setOffset","updateOffset","newOffset","refBBox","getBoundingClientRect","viewportHeight","innerHeight","top","fullPageHeight","document","documentElement","offsetHeight","pageBottomOffset","pageYOffset","clientRectOffset","handleScroll","requestAnimationFrame","useEffect","addEventListener","removeEventListener","Math","min","max","Section","styled","theme","SectionHeading","pt","Timespan","pb","grey","faCalendarAlt","Paragraph","gutterBottom","m","useTheme","Siddhi","mkDocs","wso2IdentityServer","apacheOpenWhisk","knative","Cellery","Ballerina","Choreo","Wso2Logo","height","my","alt","layout","objectFit","objectPosition","src","palette","mode","GsocLogo","name","content","__NEXT_P","push"],"sourceRoot":""}
